# Markdown upload test

This is a word document uploaded from Markdown (`.md`) file. I want to test uploading this markdown document, and render it to HTML format, which is being formatted and can be edit.

You can also upload these types of files:
- Markdown file (`.md`)
- Default text document (`.txt`)
